# Quick Start
This project is a blog that I document everything I read about Buddha and Buddhism. I hope it will help you to understand more about Buddhism and Buddha. I will try to update it as much as possible.
The project is written with Jekyll theme, by Pat Dryburgh, with some modifications of my own. 
The project is deployed using Github Pages.


## Guide
